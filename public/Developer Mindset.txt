1. What's the most exciting tool/stack you've explored recently?
    React.js for my semester paper 'App Development'
2. Describe how you approach debuggin when stuck.
    Go throught the statement line where the error occurs.
    If nothing wrong with that statement then I check for the previous action.
    If there is a problem with the logical error then I go for manual trace of the statements.
    Ask my friend if they encouter the some issues like that, if so then I rectify by asking them.
    Sometimes I do console printing for where exactly causes error if the process is iterative or recursion.

3. Share a link to one past project youâ€™re proud of (if any).
