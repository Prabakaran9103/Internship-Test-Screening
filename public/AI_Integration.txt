1.Which model/framework you'd choose and why?
  If I were building a chat feature powered by a language model, I will go with OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
  Because I feel that OpenAI's chatGPT performe much better in chating and interaction.

2.How you would integrate it into a Next.js app?
  Step 1: Install dependencies "npm install ai openai"
  Step 2: Create a route.ts in the specified directory and handle the POST and GET request and responses
  Step 3: Create a page component for front end and request the services from server using fetch()

3.How you'd handle input/output and streaming responses
  Input elements are passed to handle functions via useChat()
  Output responses stream token-by-token and appear in real time.
  The OpenAI SDK + Vercel AI stream utility enables smooth, efficient token streaming without requiring WebSockets.
